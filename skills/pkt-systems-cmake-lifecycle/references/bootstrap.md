# Bootstrap Procedure

## Bootstrap Procedure

For a new repository:

1. Extract product name, C library name, namespace, binary name, public headers, examples, dependencies, Lua needs, e2e services, target matrix, and artifact types from the spec.
2. Define the public C API shape before implementation: handle style, receiver shells or opaque handles, transparent config/value structs, required free functions, ownership rules, error surface, streaming/spooling names, examples, and compatibility promises.
3. Create the repository layout and `.gitignore`. Ignore generated release/version files such as `/VERSION` so git worktrees do not treat a checked-in version file as the version source.
4. Create `CMakeLists.txt` with project-prefixed options, static/shared library targets, install rules, package config generation, tests, examples, fuzz/bench/e2e hooks as needed, dependency root variables, and strict warning policy for project-owned C.
5. Create `CMakePresets.json` with the required presets and only relevant optional presets.
6. Create `.clang-format` by dumping the tool's LLVM baseline config with `clang-format -style=llvm -dump-config > .clang-format`, then make any deliberate project style edits in that checked-in file. Do not rely on an implicit clang-format style.
7. Create `Makefile` with the standard surface, including slice, prerelease, hardening, packaging, and optional service/Lua/fuzz targets when those surfaces exist.
8. Create lifecycle scripts only where Make would become stateful or unreadable. When cross-target packaging, Darwin artifacts, or runtime-path verification are in scope, include shared target-tool discovery such as `scripts/discover_target_tools.sh` instead of duplicating lookup in package scripts.
9. Add tests first for public API, preferred API style, error behavior, allocator/ownership behavior, install-tree consumers, dependency modes, version resolution, source archive smoke, packaging, target-tool discovery when cross artifacts are shipped, and any e2e/Lua/fuzz/benchmark surfaces.
10. Implement the code to satisfy the tests.
11. Run the narrow gates, then the prerelease tier, then release-matrix or `make package-verify`.
