# Migration Procedure

## Migration Procedure

For an existing repository:

1. Inventory current public API, ABI, binaries, examples, tests, dependencies, release artifacts, e2e services, Lua artifacts, benchmarks, fuzz targets, vendored patches, and documented commands.
2. Classify each behavior into a lifecycle surface.
3. Preserve product behavior and declared artifact/consumer compatibility commitments. For pre-1.0 non-ABI refactors without an external-support commitment, prefer a clean cutover without legacy paths or shims; do not ask solely because the old non-ABI interface changes. Shared-library ABI and published bundle/dependency compatibility requirements still apply regardless of maturity.
4. Inventory public API style separately from implementation style. Prefer receiver-style handle functions for new usage. Preserve free-function compatibility surfaces when a mature API or declared support commitment requires them; otherwise follow the preceding clean-cutover rule.
5. Update examples and documentation snippets to the preferred public style and add executable checks that prevent regression to discouraged usage forms.
6. Replace bespoke command names with standard Make targets. Retain compatibility aliases only when a declared external-support commitment or explicit engineer request requires them. Documentation alone does not require legacy aliases for a pre-1.0 clean cutover.
7. Move long orchestration into standard scripts.
8. Normalize presets, target IDs, dependency roots, cache layout, host/bundled dependency modes, and target-tool discovery for packaging and verification.
9. If package, release, Darwin, or runtime-path scripts each discover tools independently, consolidate them behind a shared helper such as `scripts/discover_target_tools.sh` and add regression tests for configured CMake cache values, compiler sibling tools, osxcross-prefixed tools, and PATH fallback.
10. Add missing verification before deleting old behavior.
11. Remove dead lifecycle paths after the standard targets pass.
12. Run the relevant gates and report any remaining unsupported surfaces.

For non-trivial migrations, maintain `docs/lifecycle-migration.md` until the migration is complete. It should record:

- old command or behavior;
- new lifecycle command or surface;
- behavior preserved;
- verification added;
- behavior removed, deprecated, or intentionally changed;
- engineer decisions still required.

The migration ledger exists to prevent silent loss of bespoke project behavior. Keep it concise and delete it only when the repository has fully converged and the engineer does not want the ledger retained as documentation.
