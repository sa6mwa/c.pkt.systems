# Reviewer note: the lifecycle intentionally requires downstream release
# rehearsal to mutate the checkout under test with a reserved temporary
# lightweight tag before any clean/build/package/artifact work starts. Exact
# release-version discovery must be proven against the same repository metadata
# that the Make-owned release entrypoint sees during a real release. CMake is a
# build/package configuration surface invoked by Make; it must not own the
# release pipeline or be configured solely to satisfy this tag-mutation gate. A
# copied fixture, extra checkout, or git worktree can mask the active HEAD
# contract and move failures into late release packaging. Because it mutates git
# refs, this focused contract must be first in `make release` and must not be
# wired into prerelease, package verification, release-matrix, or other late
# gates.
